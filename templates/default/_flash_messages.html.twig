   This is a template fragment designed to be included in other templates
   See https://symfony.com/doc/current/templates.html#including-templates

   A common practice to better distinguish between templates and fragments is to
   prefix fragments with an underscore. That's why this template is called
   '_flash_messages.html.twig' instead of 'flash_messages.html.twig'

   The check is needed to prevent starting the session when looking for "flash messages":
   https://symfony.com/doc/current/session.html#avoid-starting-sessions-for-anonymous-users

   TIP: With FOSHttpCache you can also adapt this to make it cache safe:
